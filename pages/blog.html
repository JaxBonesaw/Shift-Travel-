      <h2>True Your Wheels Like a Pro</h2>
      <h5>Tech Adcvice, Dec 7, 2020</h5>

      <p>WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE, YOU CAN ADD THIS USEFUL SKILL TO YOUR HOME-MECHANIC REPERTOIRE</p>
      <p>You’ll be able to see if your wheel needs to be trued. “An out-of-true wheel will be wobbling laterally, from non-drive side to drive side,” says McCloud. Lift up your bike, spin a wheel, and take a look at it from the front or rear. If you can see it wobbling more than five millimeters left to right, it’s time for a wheel true. In extreme cases, an untrue wheel’s rim might make contact with rim brake pads, or the tire will rub the seat stays or chainstays.</p>
        
        <p>“For safety, I recommend checking your wheel true before every ride,” says McCloud. “Especially with a front wheel—if it’s bad enough that it hits your brake pads and stops you, then you’re going over the bars.”</p>
        
        <p>Because they’re so much stronger, carbon wheels require truing less frequently than aluminum ones, and when they do, you’ll just see small warps in the shape, so you’ll have to look a bit closer. While aluminum can flex and bend without actually cracking under stress, if you see a big warp in a carbon rim, it’s likely that the rim has actually cracked...<a href="https://www.bicycling.com/repair/a34714869/how-to-true-a-bike-wheel/"> Read More At---</a></p>

      <h2>Packing Hacks for an Inexpensive Tour</h2>
      <h5>Travel Tips, March 2, 2021</h5>
      <div class="blogimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>I GOT INTO ADVENTURE CYCLING BEFORE I GOT INTO THE INTERNET</p>
        
      <p>No phone, no GPS, no iPod. I used paper maps and stopped at libraries to call home on Skype. Even when I wasn’t cycling, I lived in off-grid tiny houses on farms with limited or no transportation, cell service, or internet. For most of my adult life, I’ve been blissfully connected to reality. I’m a very strange millennial.</p>
        
        <p>Finally when I turned 30, I noticed that society had grown around me in a way I no longer understood. So I bought my first smartphone and decided to “learn the internet.” I was in Central America, so I took the phone back to my little open-air cabin in the jungle. I practiced pressing the buttons and seeing what happened. A friend sat down with me and explained things like hashtags, memes, and celebrity cats. She helped me set up an Instagram account and taught me how to like things. I’ve been tethered ever since.</p>
        
        <p>I started posting pictures of my life and my bike trips, and that seemed like a fun thing to do. But the more I scrolled through photos of other people cycling, the stranger I felt. It was the first time I’d ever been exposed to “bike culture,” and it was deeply unsettling. “Oh my gawd,” I finally realized, “I’ve been doing everything wrong.”</p>
        
        <p>Everywhere I looked on the internet, people obsessed about two things: speed and fashion. It was all about this lighter bike shoe and that cooler bike bag and the other latest minuscule development in gear I had never heard of. Bike culture seemed to revolve around how to go fast while looking sporty and spending the most money possible. I felt completely flummoxed.</p>
        
        <p>All my life, I’d been doing the opposite: cycling kind of slowly while looking goofy and trying to spend the least money possible. Someone asked me recently what I love about cycling, and I answered without hesitation, “the disappearing.” I love the feeling of disappearing into the wind — body in motion, thoughts and breath and anxieties trailing off in my wake. For me, it’s not about the bike or the gear or the fashion statement. It’s about being there, pedaling.<a href="https://www.adventurecycling.org/blog/packing-hacks-for-an-inexpensive-bike-tour/"> Read More At---</a></p>
